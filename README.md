###Description:
This package was developed during my time in Raman Research Institute while working
with Prof Avinash Deshpande (*'desh'*). This is an attempt to systematically refactor
the highly inefficient and unreadable code which I had written during my naive days.

The idea is to use OOPs to build a simple data processing tool for pulsar data.
