### Description:

This package was developed during my time at Raman Research Institute while working
with Prof Avinash Deshpande (*'desh'*). This is an attempt to systematically refactor
the highly inefficient and unreadable code which I had written during my naive days.

The objective of the 4 month thesis project was to study the radio emissions of a drifter
pulsar at different bands to better understand the magnetosphere. More information can be found 
in my Thesis Report ([Drifting_Subpulse_Thesis.pdf](Drifting_Subpulse_Thesis.pdf))

The idea here is to use OOPs to build a simple data processing tool for pulsar data.
